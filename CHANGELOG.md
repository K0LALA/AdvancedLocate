# 1.1.0

* Added `/slime nearest`, locating for the nearest Slime chunk, searching in a spiral pattern, in a radius of 2, happens very rarely but a Slime chunk can not be found within the radius.
* Added `/slime density [radius] [neighour_radius]`, searching for the point with the highest density of Slime chunks around, useful for Slime farms

# 1.0.1

* Changed icon.
* Added default amount for searching structures, now `/loc structure nearest [structure]` is possible, searching for 5 structures, note you can still specify the amount of structures.
* Added max delay for searching multiple structures, being 15 seconds, _I plan on adding this option in the configs_.

# 1.0.0

* Search for multiple structures of the same type at once.
