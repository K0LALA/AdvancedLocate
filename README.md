# Advanced Locate

## Features

This mod aims to upgrade the Vanilla locate command by adding new functionalities.
They cover the 3 sub-commands (POI, biome and structure) adding multiple search and a slime chunk finder as a POI.

## Usage

To use the commands, type /loc in the chat, or whatever you set in the configuration.

* `/loc structure nearest (amount) [structure]`, `amount` is the number of structures you want to be displayed, max being 10 and set to 5 by default. `structure` is the structure you want to search for. Please note it may not be totally accurate due to the finding algorithm.
