# Advanced Locate

## Features

This mod aims to upgrade the Vanilla locate command by adding new functionalities.
They cover the 3 sub-commands (POI, biome and structure) adding multiple search, radius search and a slime chunk finder as a POI.
When searching for structures, you have the Y coordinates included.

## Usage

To use the commands, type /loc in the chat, or whatever you set in the configuration.

* `/loc structure nearest [amount] [structure] (max_radius)`, max_radius default value being 10000.
* `/loc structure radius [radius] [structure] (max_amount)`, max_amount being 10.
